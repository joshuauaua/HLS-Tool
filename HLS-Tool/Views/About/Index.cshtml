            This project is developed by 
            <a href="https://www.sonicassembly.se" target="_blank" class="fw-bold">Sonic Assembly</a>,
            a creative sound studio based in Stockholm.  
            Our mission is to build useful tools, infrastructure and 
            open-source solutions in the music tech space — enabling 
            artists, developers, and creators to explore new sonic ideas.

        <h2 class="fw-semibold">Why Open Source?</h2>
        <p>
            The streaming world moves fast. Instead of every team reinventing 
            the wheel — transcoding pipelines, uploading logic, storage orchestration — 
            we wanted to provide a clean starting point for anyone building audio-driven products.
        </p>
        <p>
            This toolkit is free to use, improve, and build upon.
        </p>
